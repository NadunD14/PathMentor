# PathMentor

**PathMentor** is a web platform that helps users discover the most effective learning paths based on their personal preferences, goals, and learning styles. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the platform dynamically generates personalized learning paths, guiding users step-by-step toward their learning objectives.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Learning Paths**: AI-driven recommendations generate custom learning paths based on the user's category selection (e.g., Programming, Design, Business), learning style, and time availability.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication with **Supabase Auth** for sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Dynamic Questionnaires**: AI-powered questionnaires to gather user preferences and tailor learning paths accordingly.
- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Track progress on the learning path and receive real-time updates.
- **Machine Learning Backend**: **Flask** backend processes user data, interacts with machine learning models, and provides recommendations.
- **Database**: **Supabase** used for managing user profiles, learning paths, and progress tracking.
- **AI/ML Models**: Integrates **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Keras** for building and deploying recommendation models.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **Next.js** - Server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing.
- **React** - Component-based UI.
- **CSS** - Styling and layout.

### Backend:
- **Flask** - REST API for user data processing and ML model inference.
- **Supabase** - User authentication and real-time data storage (PostgreSQL).
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, **Scikit-learn** - Used for machine learning and recommendation system.

### Database:
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) - User profiles, preferences, learning paths, and progress data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (for Next.js frontend)
- **Python** (for Flask backend)
- **Supabase** account for authentication and database.
- **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, **Keras** for the backend machine learning models.

### Setup Instructions

#### Frontend (Next.js)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/best-way-to-learn.git
   cd best-way-to-learn
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:

ini
Copy
Edit
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Your Next.js app will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Backend (Flask)
Navigate to the backend/ directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
Set up a Python virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Your Flask backend will be running at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
POST /generate-path: This endpoint receives user data and returns a personalized learning path based on the user's preferences and category.
